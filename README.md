# mycolors.vim #

This is my vim colorscheme file.  It's basically just a copy of
[Molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) with some tweaks.

I parked it here mainly for ease of managing with vundle but you're
certainly free to use it if you wish.

### Side note ###
If you prefer working with a dark backgrounded colorscheme, Molokai
is a great looking, easy to read, and really comprehensive set that
can be used either as is or as a good base to start from if you want
to customize it.
